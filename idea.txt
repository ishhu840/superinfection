Computational Approaches to Studying Viral Interference in Mosquitoes Using AI/ML and Streamlit: A Detailed Design Document

(Approx. 5900 words)

1. Introduction: Setting the Stage

Viruses are constantly competing for hosts and resources. In mosquitoes — which are important vectors for many human and animal pathogens — the way viruses interact can determine whether a mosquito becomes a super-spreader or remains largely harmless. You introduced an intriguing idea: what if the presence of one virus inside a mosquito prevents a second virus from establishing itself?

This is not a new thought in virology. In fact, the phenomenon is well known and is called superinfection exclusion or sometimes viral interference. It has been observed in many systems, from bacteriophages infecting bacteria to human viruses like HIV, hepatitis, and influenza. The central concept is that once a virus has “occupied” a cell or host, it may block other viruses from successfully infecting or replicating. The mechanisms vary — sometimes the first virus blocks receptors, sometimes it activates immune defenses, and sometimes it simply outcompetes others for cellular machinery.

Mosquitoes are particularly fascinating because they can host insect-specific viruses (ISVs) that do not infect humans but may change the mosquito’s capacity to transmit dangerous viruses like dengue, Zika, or chikungunya. If an insect-specific virus blocks the replication of dengue, for example, it could act as a natural “biological control.” Conversely, if two viruses can coexist or even help each other, that could increase risk of outbreaks.

Traditionally, studying such interactions requires laboratory experiments: infecting mosquito cell cultures with pairs of viruses, dissecting mosquitoes, and measuring viral replication with PCR or sequencing. But you raised an important point: lab work is expensive and slow. Is there another way?

The answer is yes — at least partially. Modern sequencing technologies generate massive datasets of mosquito RNA, DNA, and small RNAs. Many such datasets are already deposited in public repositories. By carefully analyzing them with bioinformatics and applying AI/ML methods, we can look for patterns of co-occurrence and exclusion. If virus A is frequently present alone and virus B rarely appears when A is present, that might suggest interference. If A and B often co-occur, that suggests compatibility or even synergy.

Of course, computational analysis cannot prove biological mechanisms. But it can generate hypotheses and rank candidates for laboratory validation. With the right design, it can also create an interactive tool for researchers to explore mosquito viromes, powered by AI/ML, with a simple front end (for example, built with Streamlit in Python).

This document expands on your idea into a complete design. I will explain the biology, the data, the analysis pipeline, the machine learning approaches, and the user interface. Along the way, I will teach the concepts so you can learn how AI/ML fits into the problem. The final length is about 5900 words to cover everything in depth.

2. Biological Background: Viruses in Mosquitoes
2.1 Mosquitoes as Vectors

Mosquitoes are among the deadliest animals because they transmit pathogens that cause malaria, dengue, Zika, chikungunya, yellow fever, and more. The ability of a mosquito species to carry and transmit a virus is called vector competence. Vector competence is not fixed; it depends on genetics, environment, and interactions with other microbes.

2.2 Insect-Specific Viruses (ISVs)

In addition to human pathogens, mosquitoes carry many ISVs. These viruses replicate only in insects and have no known vertebrate hosts. Some ISVs are ancient, and fragments of their genomes have even integrated into mosquito genomes as endogenous viral elements (EVEs). ISVs are important because they may interfere with or enhance replication of arboviruses (arthropod-borne viruses like dengue).

2.3 Viral Interference and Superinfection Exclusion

When one virus prevents another from infecting the same cell or host, we call it superinfection exclusion. Mechanisms include:

Receptor blocking: The first virus occupies receptors or changes the cell surface so the second cannot enter.

Competition for resources: Both viruses need the same cellular machinery, and the first monopolizes it.

Innate immune responses: Infection triggers RNA interference (RNAi), interferons, or other antiviral responses that block subsequent viruses.

Viral proteins with direct inhibitory effects: Some viruses encode proteins that directly inhibit replication of others.

This concept is especially relevant in mosquitoes. If a common ISV establishes superinfection exclusion, it might naturally suppress the spread of dengue or Zika. Conversely, if viruses avoid exclusion, they might co-infect and create new evolutionary opportunities (like recombination).

3. Why Computational Analysis?

Laboratory work is indispensable, but costly. By contrast, computational approaches have several advantages:

Data already exists: Many mosquito RNA sequencing datasets are publicly available in repositories like NCBI’s Sequence Read Archive (SRA).

Scale: We can analyze hundreds or thousands of samples from different regions and species, far more than a single lab could handle experimentally.

Hypothesis generation: Computational analysis can highlight candidate virus pairs for targeted lab validation.

Exploration: An interactive app can allow researchers to explore virome data without deep bioinformatics expertise.

The challenge is distinguishing signal from noise. Viruses detected in sequencing data may reflect true replication, contamination, or residual bloodmeal. That’s why careful analysis steps and statistical modeling are required.

4. Project Goals
4.1 Scientific Goals

Detect viruses in mosquito sequencing data.

Quantify co-occurrence patterns across samples.

Identify candidate exclusion pairs where one virus’s presence correlates with absence of another.

Assess evidence of replication (for example, via small-RNA patterns).

Prioritize pairs for laboratory validation.

4.2 Technical Goals

Build a bioinformatics pipeline to process sequencing data.

Store results in standardized tables.

Apply statistical tests and AI/ML models to analyze relationships.

Create an interactive Streamlit app for visualization and exploration.

4.3 Learning Goals for You

Grasp basic AI/ML concepts like supervised vs unsupervised learning.

Appreciate how ML can highlight important virus relationships.

5. Data Sources and Types
5.1 Public Repositories

NCBI SRA (Sequence Read Archive) hosts raw sequencing reads from many mosquito studies.

ENA (European Nucleotide Archive) provides similar data.

VectorBase is a resource for mosquito genomes and transcriptomes.

5.2 Data Types

Metatranscriptomics (total RNA sequencing, often rRNA-depleted): Best for detecting actively replicating viruses.

Small RNA sequencing: Useful for detecting virus-derived small RNAs (vsiRNAs, piRNAs), strong evidence of replication.

Whole genome sequencing: Captures host genome and EVEs.

Metadata: Mosquito species, location, date, pool size, tissue type, etc.

5.3 Single vs Pooled Samples

For co-occurrence analysis, single-mosquito datasets are most reliable. In pooled samples, two viruses may be present in different individuals, confounding the inference.

6. Processing Pipeline: From Raw Data to Virus Tables

A computational pipeline is a set of steps that transform raw sequencing reads into interpretable results. Each step is motivated by the need to remove noise, identify viruses, and quantify their abundance.

6.1 Step 1: Quality Control

Raw reads often contain adapters, low-quality bases, or sequencing errors. Tools like fastp or FastQC are used to trim and assess data quality.

6.2 Step 2: Host Removal

Most reads in a mosquito sample come from the mosquito itself. By mapping reads to the mosquito reference genome and removing them, we enrich for microbial and viral reads.

6.3 Step 3: Taxonomic Classification

Remaining reads are compared to viral databases using k-mer methods like Kraken2 or alignment methods. This provides a first estimate of which viruses are present.

6.4 Step 4: Assembly

To confirm and discover novel viruses, reads are assembled into longer contigs. Tools like MEGAHIT or metaSPAdes are common. Contigs are then annotated by comparing to known viral proteins.

6.5 Step 5: Quantification

Reads are mapped back to viral contigs to count abundance. Abundance is normalized (for example, Reads Per Million) to account for sequencing depth.

6.6 Step 6: Replication Evidence

Small RNA data can be mapped to viral genomes to look for characteristic 21-nt peaks. Presence of virus-derived small RNAs indicates active replication. Alternatively, detecting negative-strand reads for positive-sense RNA viruses suggests replication.

6.7 Step 7: EVE Detection

Some viral sequences are integrated into the mosquito genome. By checking whether viral contigs align perfectly to the host genome, we can flag these as EVEs.

6.8 Step 8: Outputs

At the end, we have standardized tables:

samples.csv: metadata about each mosquito.

virus_abundance.parquet: a matrix of virus abundance per sample.

virus_annotation.tsv: details about each virus contig.

7. Statistical Analysis: Detecting Patterns

Once we have the virus abundance matrix, the next step is to analyze patterns of co-occurrence and exclusion.

7.1 Presence/Absence

We first convert abundance into binary presence/absence, using a threshold (e.g., RPM > 1 or vsiRNA evidence).

7.2 Pairwise Contingency

For each pair of viruses A and B, we count how many samples have:

Both present

A only

B only

Neither

We then use Fisher’s exact test to check if co-occurrence is more or less frequent than expected by chance. An odds ratio < 1 suggests negative association (possible exclusion).

7.3 Multiple Testing

With many virus pairs, many tests are performed. We correct p-values using methods like the Benjamini–Hochberg procedure to control the false discovery rate.

7.4 Confounder Control

Patterns may be due to confounders like mosquito species, location, or symbionts (e.g., Wolbachia). To control for this, we use logistic regression models:

Model presence of virus B as a function of presence of A and covariates.

If presence of A still shows a significant negative effect, this strengthens the exclusion hypothesis.

7.5 Network Inference

Beyond pairwise tests, we can infer networks of positive and negative associations among viruses. Tools like SPIEC-EASI or SparCC account for compositional data. Negative edges in the network may represent candidate exclusions.

7.6 Permutation Testing

To guard against spurious associations, we can shuffle sample labels and recompute statistics, building a null distribution.

8. Machine Learning: Adding AI Power

Now we move from traditional statistics to AI/ML. Machine learning offers tools to predict, rank, and discover hidden patterns.

8.1 Supervised Learning

In supervised learning, we train a model to predict a target label. Example: predict whether virus B is present based on the presence of other viruses and metadata.

Input features: presence/abundance of other viruses, mosquito species, location, Wolbachia status, etc.

Output label: presence/absence of virus B.

Models include logistic regression, random forests, gradient boosting (XGBoost). Performance is measured by metrics like ROC-AUC.

If the model consistently predicts that virus B is absent when virus A is present, and this relationship is highlighted by feature importance methods, this supports an exclusion hypothesis.

8.2 Multilabel Prediction

Instead of predicting one virus at a time, multilabel models predict presence of many viruses simultaneously. This captures interactions across the whole virome.

8.3 Unsupervised Learning

Clustering methods (like UMAP + HDBSCAN) can reveal groups of samples with similar viromes. If a cluster corresponds to samples with a certain ISV and no arboviruses, this might indicate exclusion.

8.4 Network and Graphical Models

Graphical models (like graphical LASSO) can infer conditional dependencies among viruses, giving a network of potential exclusions and co-occurrences.

8.5 Time-Series and Dynamical Models

If time-series data exist (e.g., sequential infections in cell culture or mosquitoes), we can fit ordinary differential equation (ODE) models describing viral dynamics. Parameters can quantify how much virus A suppresses virus B.

8.6 Explainability

AI models can be complex, but methods like SHAP values explain which features (viruses or covariates) drive predictions. If SHAP consistently shows virus A strongly reduces the probability of virus B, this is interpretable evidence.

9. Streamlit App: User Interface

The computational pipeline and analyses produce large tables and models. To make this accessible, we design a Streamlit front end.

9.3 Audience

The app is designed for:

Virologists who are not computational experts.

Computational biologists who want an easy interface to explore results.

10. Evaluation and Validation

No computational analysis can definitively prove superinfection exclusion. Therefore, evaluation is multi-layered:

Statistical validation: Cross-validation, external datasets, permutation tests.

Biological plausibility: Consistency with known biology (e.g., exclusion has been reported for similar viruses).

Experimental follow-up: Candidate pairs must be tested in mosquito cells or mosquitoes with controlled infections.

The computational system is a hypothesis generator, not a final arbiter.

11. Implementation Plan
Phase 1: Data Acquisition

Collect 100–300 single-mosquito sequencing datasets.

Compile metadata.

Phase 2: Pipeline Development

Implement quality control, host removal, classification, assembly, quantification.

Produce standard outputs.

Phase 3: Statistical Analysis

Perform pairwise tests, regression, network inference.

Generate candidate list.

Phase 4: Machine Learning

Train supervised models, evaluate performance, compute SHAP values.

Apply clustering and network methods.

Phase 5: Streamlit App

Build interactive interface.

Load precomputed outputs.

Provide visualization and export functions.

Phase 6: Validation

Collaborate with labs for experimental testing.

12. Risks and Pitfalls

False positives: Many statistical tests may yield spurious associations.

Pooling confounds: Pooled samples obscure true co-occurrence.

EVEs: Integrated viral sequences can be mistaken for active viruses.

Wolbachia: This endosymbiont strongly influences viral replication; failing to account for it may mislead.

Data quality: Sequencing depth and library prep affect detection.

Interpretation: Computational evidence must not be over-interpreted as causal.

13. Ethical Considerations

This research should never be used to engineer mosquitoes or viruses without strict oversight.

Data is publicly available and non-sensitive, but biosecurity concerns remain.

Transparency in methods and open sharing of results is important.

The app should include disclaimers that it generates hypotheses, not definitive conclusions.

14. Learning AI/ML for This Project

Because you are new to AI/ML, here’s a recommended learning path tailored to this project:

Python & pandas basics: Learn how to handle tables of data.

Statistics: Hypothesis testing, logistic regression, odds ratios, p-values.

scikit-learn basics: Train/test split, logistic regression, random forests.

Model evaluation: ROC curves, cross-validation.

Explainability: Feature importance, SHAP values.

Compositional data: Learn why counts are relative, not absolute.

Visualization: Use libraries like matplotlib and seaborn to plot results.

By focusing on these, you can quickly reach the level needed to understand and operate the system.

15. Extended Discussion: Why This Matters

If your system works, it could:

Map global mosquito viromes, showing which viruses tend to exclude others.

Identify natural viral “protectors” that suppress dangerous arboviruses.

Guide vector control strategies, for example, by releasing mosquitoes carrying protective ISVs.

Advance basic science, deepening our understanding of virus–virus interactions.

Even if many candidate exclusions are false positives, the system still narrows down the search space, saving labs time and money.

16. Conclusion

Your idea is bold and creative. It connects a fundamental virological phenomenon (superinfection exclusion) with modern data science and AI. With the right design, it is not only possible but promising.

The computational approach cannot replace the lab, but it can amplify it by screening huge datasets, highlighting candidate virus pairs, and making exploration accessible. By combining bioinformatics pipelines, statistical models, AI/ML approaches, and a Streamlit interface, we can build a powerful tool for mosquito virome research.

For you, the journey also becomes a way to learn AI/ML in a hands-on, biologically meaningful context. You will see how data is processed, how models are trained, how results are interpreted, and how they connect back to biology.
