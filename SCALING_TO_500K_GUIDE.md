# Scaling Mosquito Viral Analysis to 500K+ Samples

## Current Status
- **Current Dataset**: 20 real mosquito genome samples from NCBI SRA
- **Target Dataset**: 500,000+ samples for comprehensive viral cooccurrence analysis
- **Challenge**: Scale data collection, processing, and analysis by 25,000x

## Strategy 1: Automated NCBI SRA Collection Pipeline

### Implementation Steps
1. **Expand SRA Search Parameters**
   ```bash
   # Current search: limited keywords
   # Expanded search: comprehensive taxonomy + geographic coverage
   esearch -db sra -query "(Aedes[Organism] OR Anopheles[Organism] OR Culex[Organism]) AND genomic[Strategy]"
   ```

2. **Automated Download Pipeline**
   - Use `sra-tools` with parallel processing
   - Implement retry mechanisms for failed downloads
   - Geographic distribution targeting (Africa, Asia, Americas, Europe)
   - Time-series data (2010-2024) for temporal analysis

3. **Expected Yield**
   - **Aedes species**: ~150,000 samples
   - **Anopheles species**: ~200,000 samples  
   - **Culex species**: ~100,000 samples
   - **Other mosquito genera**: ~50,000 samples
   - **Total**: 500,000+ samples

## Strategy 2: Multi-Database Integration

### Primary Sources
1. **NCBI SRA** (Sequence Read Archive)
   - Largest repository: ~2M mosquito-related entries
   - Raw sequencing data from global studies

2. **ENA** (European Nucleotide Archive)
   - Mirror of SRA with additional European datasets
   - ~500K additional unique samples

3. **DDBJ** (DNA Data Bank of Japan)
   - Asian-focused mosquito genomics
   - ~100K samples from Japan, China, Southeast Asia

4. **VectorBase**
   - Specialized vector genomics database
   - Curated, high-quality genomes
   - ~50K reference-quality samples

### Collection Pipeline
```python
# Automated multi-database collector
class MassiveGenomeCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.databases = ['ncbi_sra', 'ena', 'ddbj', 'vectorbase']
        self.target_samples = 500000
        
    def collect_from_all_sources(self):
        # Parallel collection from multiple databases
        # Deduplication based on sequence similarity
        # Quality filtering and metadata extraction
        pass
```

## Strategy 3: Cloud Computing Infrastructure

### AWS/Google Cloud Setup
1. **Storage Requirements**
   - Raw data: ~500TB (1GB average per sample)
   - Processed data: ~50TB
   - Results/indices: ~5TB
   - **Total**: ~555TB storage needed

2. **Compute Requirements**
   - BLAST analysis: 500K samples Ã— 30 minutes = 250K CPU hours
   - Recommended: 1000 CPU cluster for 10 days
   - Cost estimate: $50,000-100,000 for full analysis

3. **Parallel Processing Architecture**
   ```yaml
   # Kubernetes deployment for massive scale
   apiVersion: batch/v1
   kind: Job
   metadata:
     name: viral-analysis-500k
   spec:
     parallelism: 1000  # 1000 parallel workers
     completions: 500000  # 500K samples to process
   ```

## Strategy 4: Collaborative Research Networks

### Academic Partnerships
1. **Vector Biology Consortiums**
   - Join existing mosquito genomics collaborations
   - Access to unpublished datasets
   - Shared computational resources

2. **International Mosquito Surveillance Networks**
   - WHO Global Vector Control Response
   - CDC ArboNET surveillance
   - European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control

3. **Citizen Science Integration**
   - iNaturalist mosquito observations with GPS
   - Community-contributed samples
   - Mobile app for field collection coordination

## Strategy 5: Real-Time Data Streaming

### Live Database Integration
```python
# Real-time data pipeline
class RealTimeGenomeStream:
    def __init__(self):
        self.sources = {
            'ncbi_sra': 'daily_updates',
            'ena': 'weekly_sync',
            'field_stations': 'real_time'
        }
    
    def stream_new_samples(self):
        # Continuous monitoring for new submissions
        # Automatic quality control and viral analysis
        # Real-time dashboard updates
        pass
```
